Hey, while I was doing some deep cleaning, the sticky notes from the Microsoft gaming brainstormerama I ran fell down. These are not all videogames. Here are some of my favorites:

## Persistent MMORPG
- You control a soul
- NPCs are intelligent
- Biggest gameplay element: possess NPCs
- You write history as you enter NPCs, whether they be peasants, blacksmiths, knights, or kings
- Struggle for power

## Card game construction API
- Common API for defining rules, placement, scoring, etc
- Would be cool to turn the rules into a playable web app game

## Tic-tac-toe Beer Pong
- This was my million-dollar idea

## A parkour game
- Similar to Mirror's Edge, but no guns
- Maybe 2D?

I don't know what Mirror's Edge is, but this would be neat if you got style boosts, which gave you extra speed in order to solve a puzzle or make a jump. I can see this as a very fun platformer with bonus tokens required to 100% the level.

## Micro-RTS
- control more units than LoL or Dota 2, but less than Starcraft

## AI Game for Programmers
- Each player writes an AI that faces off against other players. Leader board based on ELO system
- Not sure what game goal/rules are (could be a battle bot kind of thing)
- Easy to make several modes with different goals and rules

## Survival Horror
- Emphasis on atmosphere rather than cheap scares
- You're alone, that's scary

## WoW with only dungeons
- NOT an MMO
- Awesome boss battles

This is basically the same idea I had from WC3. In WC3 there was a game called Impossible Bosses, where you would start the game and pick a class, go to the shop and buy some stuff, go to the first boss. If anyone on your team killed the boss, you all got revived and got to spend some more gold. This was some incredibly fun and intense stuff.

I imagine it as a MOBA style game in a PvE format. So one champion, controlled like an RTS game, with limited abilities.

## Tower Defense Tycoon
- Not sure how this would work...

## Tower Defense Creator
- Create schematics for TDs
- Play with friends
- Watch as the world plays your game

## Bocce Ball with Obstacles
- Suffices to say this might be fun

## Play multiple games with the same controls at the same time
- Might be interesting functionality to control multiple games at the same time
- Maybe one button behaves differently to give you an interesting puzzle

## Tower Defense vs Human Players
- Humans control creeps and stuff
- Can attack towers too?

## Music-based arcade shooter
- Enemies are timed to the beat
