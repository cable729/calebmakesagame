Unreal Engine 4 is not a run and debug type of game, kind of like XNA. If you like coding, you'll choose the code project option, and launch into Visual Studio. You have to install some stuff and change some settings, but then you can build it (F5) and it'll compile your code and launch the Unreal Editor. Thankfully if you want to edit a few things you can do so and then click Compile in the editor (doesn't work for everything). I got a silly little game working though! You must get the pizza...
