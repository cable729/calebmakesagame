Yes guyssssss, finally got the camera pointing in the right direction. I had to set `Use Controller View Rotation` to false. Then when the character posessed the camera, it didn't point straight forward and points downward at an angle like a proper RTS camera. I also got it set up so pressing UP or W triggers an event. Next I have to figure out how to move the camera, and after that I will capture when the mouse is at the edge of the screen. Cool stuff, I'm excited to finally start getting some stuff.
