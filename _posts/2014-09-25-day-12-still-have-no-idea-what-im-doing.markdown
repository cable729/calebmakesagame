I'm still trying to figure out Unreal, and it is a pain. It's so unlike everything I've used before. I think I'll have to start really simple. Tomorrow I'm going to try again to make an RTS camera. Right. Here's some steps.

1. Create a new empty project
2. Create a camera and point it down. I think I should have the player invisible and put on the ground, and attach a camera to that component root.
3. Add an input event on W and move forward.
4. Add it for the others and up/down/left/right.
5. Add mouse movement.
6. Have the Z (distance from ground) depend on the height of terrain.
