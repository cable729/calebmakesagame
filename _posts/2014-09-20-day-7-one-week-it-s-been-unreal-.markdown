I went through some tutorials on melonJS and got something decent out of it. I'm not sure how much I like the engine so far though. Here's what I did:

I made a tileset in Tiled. Pretty damn easy. I downloaded a random tileset from Google images and just created a simple map.

Here's what it looks like being rendered in the game.

Kind of stretched, the debug panel is stretched. I'm not sure what the problem is here, but a quick Google result turns up nothing. I need to look more into it to see if I can fix this, but in the meantime I bought Unreal Engine 4.

It might be just as easy to make a game in Unreal as it is in here. I don't know, but I'm excited to mess around in UE4!

BTW, you can see my source code for the HTML5 game [here](https://github.com/cable729/bluejay).
