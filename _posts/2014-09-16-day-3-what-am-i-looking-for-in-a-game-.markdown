This is going to have to be short, since I don't have much time (25 minutes til midnight). I'll list off some attributes I've appreciated in games before:

1. Competition (LoL)
1. Not too much luck (LoL, TDs)
1. Beautiful world to explore (WoW)
1. Deep lore & backstory
1. Skills that can be improved
1. Stats that can be theorycrafted (TDs, WoW, WC3)
1. Fun to play with friends (RkR, LoL, WoW)

So that's just a few things. I could go on and on I'm sure, and the more I do, the more I realize that one game can't fulfill these all. There's simply too much. I liked RkR and LoL for different reasons. In all honesty, I don't have enough easy, non-competitive games to play with friends right now. Maybe if I make a kick-ass game, I can fill this niche. I think that's what I'll do.

Since this is a short one, I'll come up with some goals for stuff to accomplish tomorrow. Tomorrow I'd like to flesh out a few game ideas. I posted on my local game-dev group, and I think there is a meeting later this week. I'd like to have some on-paper mock-ups done by that meeting so I can have them "play-test" and get some good feedback.
