SHIT. Sorry guys, I am currently hosting a party and realized I'm 6 minutes from midnight! I guess I'm not used to this schedule yet. I will try to get stuff accomplished tomorrow before the Husker game. But for now, I'll just say I made progress by being hired by the company that makes the MOST POPULAR game in the WORLD.

**FUCK YEAH**
