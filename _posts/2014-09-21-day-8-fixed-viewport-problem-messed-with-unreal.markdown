Not much here. Just spent some time looking at unreal, getting it set up in Visual Studio as well as checking out the blueprint projects they have. I didn't really understand those whole flowchart programming blueprints, but oh well.

On the HTML5 engine, I fixed the viewport by changing the game's initial resolution. That's pretty much it.
