I got the camera to move left/right/up/down via multiple input schemes (arrows/wsad). Something to consider is when moving diagonally, you move ~41% faster because you're moving 1000 units in two axes instead of 1000 total. That's a minor annoyance that I might look into later.

I also got the camera to zoom in and out on mouse scroll. Currently this has no bounds. Probably should change that...
