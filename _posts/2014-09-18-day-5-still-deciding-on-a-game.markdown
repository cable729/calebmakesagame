## GDC... of UNL
So I spent some time at our college's Game Developer Club. In the past it was more of a Game Developer Team, with a project that I wasn't really interested in. It looks like the VP and some others are interested in making it into more of a club, and the projects will come separate. In fact, I hope they spawn naturally from members socializing at the club and utilizing the resources we have to offer.

## Maze Challenge mini-game
While I was sitting in the university greenspace under a tree, an apple fell down... just kidding. An old game popped into my head. It's kind of like a tower defense, except instead of killing the creeps, you place your towers in their way so it takes the longest amount of time for them to cross. Here's an example!

In this example, the X's would be rocks or something. Basically immovable objects that you have to work around to form a maze. You'd get a number of rocks and have to create a long enough maze with your remaining towers/rocks/objects.

I can see this being a very simple game to program, compared to the other games I've been considering. For one, it could be done in 2D... :) Which is a big deal! I don't know about you, but I've never created a 3d model complete with animations. I think I might make it for the web, too. This way many people could enjoy it. Platform discussion continued below...

# Features
The screenshot above allows for many variations:

- Number of obstacles & position of obstacles
- Number of structures allowed to build
- Size and shape of obstacles
- Size and shape of structures
- Various sizes and number of structures available
- Different map with different exits and obstacles

I played this map in a multiplayer environment, so I see racing and quick thinking as a big part of this game. But in fact, the main game mode could feature various levels and multiplayer could be added mode after I finish everything else. Definitely gives me something to work towards, and great intermediary steps in between!

## What the platform?!
Here's some links to some game engines for the browser:

I'm thinking that HTML5 Canvas and JS may be the way to go. Easy to show progress! I particularly like melonjs. I think tomorrow I'll set up a project and see what I can fiddle around with.
