So I was writing out how I wanted RKR to work, and I realized that for a multiplayer game to work, it has to have a lot of replay-ability. Now RKR surely does have this, but to what audience? It is PvE in essence, making it a game like pacman or donkey kong. I got to thinking that the reason this game succeeded is partially due to the fact that players could play other mini games in Warcraft 3 when they were tired of RKR.

When I was fleshing out the game, I started to realize that if I tweaked a few things, RKR is just a subset of a Maze game. What is a maze game, you ask?

## Mazesssssssss
Here is a sped up version of a single player run-through of a maze. A real game would be slower and you'd have other players running the maze with you. Only one player needs to hit the checkpoint in order to continue.

You can see how RkR is definitely similar to mazes. There's a possibility that if I created an RkR game, it would be relatively straightfoward to add mazes, maze-editor, and similar modes to the game. But still, I'm still looking at somewhat hard to program games. I do want to KISS (keep it simple, stupid) if possible.


## Caveat
There are ways to make RKR more replayable! For one, adding PvP races, maybe a 4v4 versus race. Now that I think about it, adding PvP could be separate (duplicate) tracks with teams on each separate track. However, if the teams were on the same track, there could be additional interaction. Possibly players could slow someone on the opposing team. What else could be done? I'd like to get some feedback **tomorrow**, at the Game Developers club.

## Boss Battles
This game suffers from some of the same problems as the ones before. Here's a quick description. You have multiple levels, or bosses. You have to kill the boss, which has many intricate abilities and may spawn minions to support it. When you kill it, you return to the fountain to buy items and heal to full. It is a team game, so you have to work together. You also get to pick classes at the start, so it is very similar to LoL, except it is a great PvE environment.

## U Warcraft3 much Mate?
I know, I know. I have been thinking specifically of a bunch of Wc3 games. Maybe I can get some expanded thinking when I go to the Game Dev club tomorrow. For now, I'm kind of tired. I also procrastinated this. I'll have to find something different to look forward to next time. This is as much an exercise in finishing a game as it is learning to control my instincts of procrastination and learning to find motivation in many differnt things.

Again, sorry there's still not much progress. I'll try to get more done in the future days.
