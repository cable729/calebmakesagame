I decided to give blueprints a go, and boy are they a lot easier! I don't have to look for every piece of documentation to find what I'm looking for, and it's much easier to prototype and get stuff done. I got my camera finally moving in code! I just set it up so that it continually moves upwards when the game starts. It even takes into account delta time!
